# Interview Scheduler

This project introduced us to the React framework and is designed to enable students to book interviews with listed mentors from an api database. It is a single page app where students can select from a list of available weekdays, choose an available time slot and select the mentor they'd like to book an interview with. Tested with Jest and Cypress, users can also edit/delete booked interviews in a responsive manner. 

## Setup

Install dependencies with `npm install`.
